**Ising model** is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. Each cell in the lattice has its own spin (either 1 or -1) which changes dynamically as time goes. The change depends on the ferromagnetic material temperature and external magnetic field magnitude. Our program shows how the system of spins in ferromagnetic material evolves. Red cells correspond to +1 spin, and blue cells to -1 spin.

## Content
Project consists of 2 programs:
- Program made on *Python* with a visual core
- Program made in *Unity*

So if you want to access **code**, visit:

- [IsingModel/Unity/Source/Assets/Scripts](https://github.com/HeHelios/IsingModel/tree/master/Unity/Source/Assets/Scripts) for *C#* code
- [IsingModel/Python](https://github.com/HeHelios/IsingModel/tree/master/Python) for *Python* code

If you want to check how the program works visit:

- [IsingModel/Unity/Build](https://github.com/HeHelios/IsingModel/tree/master/Unity/Build) and launch `IsingAlgorithm.exe` for *Unity* build
- [IsingModel/Python](https://github.com/HeHelios/IsingModel/tree/master/Python) and launch `IsingAlgorithm2D.py` for *Python* build
